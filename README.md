# Mini SAM
Mini SAM is a LEGO® minifigure-sized development board based on either the Microchip SAMD51G 48-Pin 32-Bit ARM® Cortex®-M4F MCU (Mini SAM M4) or the Microchip SAMD21G 48-Pin 32-Bit ARM® Cortex®-M0+ MCU running at 48Mhz.

## Board Features


### I/O
The boards includes a usb-micro interface for programming and power.   Around the edge are 0.050" spaced holes with castellations outside of that and the plan is to have a "breakout" board with standard .100" headers.  There is an optional board design in work that will be 4-layer and have the .100" smt header pads included.

The Mini SAM boards include two LED indicators; a standard "Built-In" LED and an APA102 RGB LED.  There are two built-in buttons as well; a RESET button and a user programmable BUTTON.

### Memory
In order to support CircuitPython, a 2MB Quad-SPI flash memory chip is included.  This provides plenty of space for the CircuitPython program as well as space for user programming.

### Other
The boards include a 600mA 3.3V regulator, more than enough to power this little board and its built-in features.  The micro-USB circuitry includes optional provisioning for case grounding and ESD protection.  Finally, The AREF input and recommended Analog and Digital power separation is present on the board.

Please see the BOM for each board

## Bootloader
A UF2 bootloader is available for the M4 board (will be available for the M0 when ready).  This bootloader may be built from source using my UF2 repository or downloaded from the [Minifigboards Software](https://www.minifigboards.com/mini-sam-m4/software/) page.

## Arduino
Arduino firmware is available for the M4 board as well. Instructions for adding the board to the board manager in the Arduino IDE are available on the [Minifigboards Software](https://www.minifigboards.com/mini-sam-m4/software/) page.

## CircuitPython
CircuitPython is available for the M4 board. [Mini SAM M4](https://circuitpython.org/board/mini_sam_m4/)  
CircuitPython will soon be available for the M0 board.
